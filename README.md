 09 - Name Game
- Python not able to handle: 'name(string)' * 'name(string)' so what if..
- asking to input 2 english names
- validating them, no numbers, no special characters
- turn the names into numbers by allocating the letters from the name to it`s index in alphabet: a=1, b=2 // Peter = 16+5+20+5+18 
- multiply the 2 numbers (from the names) with eachother
- result`s modulo 26 (26 letters in the US aphabet)
- turn back that number into letter, that will be the first letter of the result/new name for both the boy and girl names
- create a list with name(s) with the first letter
- if there is more than 1 items in this list: #choose randomly from this group for both the boy and girl names
- if there is no name with the first letter in the list, that is sign of the evil and the couple should not produce that type of life till I am alive
